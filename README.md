this is a simple calculator for the different grain sizes in different countries and also with diefferent materials

i also added an energie calculator for the whole load and also for each pellet and how much pellets there are in a load

have fun with it, if you got any issues report them in the issues section, if anybody got sugestions for a new project let me know ;)

thanks
